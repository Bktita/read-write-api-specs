                                        The annual equivalent rate (AER) is
                                        interest that is calculated under the
                                        assumption that any interest paid is
                                        combined with the original balance and
                                        the next interest payment will be based
                                        on the slightly higher account balance.
                                        Overall, this means that interest can be
                                        compounded several times in a year
                                        depending on the number of times that
                                        interest payments are made.

                            the aggregating of prospective buyers into groups,

                            similarly to a marketing action. Market segmentation
                            enables companies to target different categories of
                            consumers who perceive the full value of certain
                            products and services differently from one another.

                                  rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                  Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing

                                  interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and
                                  not on whole balance.

                                  The same interest rate is applied irrespective
                                  of the PCA balance

                                        The annual equivalent rate (AER) is
                                        interest that is calculated under the
                                        assumption that any interest paid is
                                        combined with the original balance and
                                        the next interest payment will be based
                                        on the slightly higher account balance.
                                        Overall, this means that interest can be
                                        compounded several times in a year
                                        depending on the number of times that
                                        interest payments are made.
