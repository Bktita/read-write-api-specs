                                          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is
                                          interest that is calculated under the
                                          assumption that any interest paid is
                                          combined with the original balance and
                                          the next interest payment will be based
                                          on the slightly higher account balance.
                                          Overall, this means that interest can be
                                          compounded several times in a year
                                          depending on the number of times that
                                          interest payments are made.

                                          interest tiers are:- 0-£500 0.1%,

                                          0.5% of the entire balance (since the
                                          account balance sits in the top interest

                                    1. Banded

                                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing
                                    rate on whole balance as balance increases.


                                    2. Tiered

                                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing
                                    rate for each tier as balance increases, but
                                    interest paid on tier fixed for that tier
                                    and not on whole balance.


                                    3. Whole

                                    The same interest rate is applied
                                    irrespective of the PCA balance

                                          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is
                                          interest that is calculated under the
                                          assumption that any interest paid is
                                          combined with the original balance and
                                          the next interest payment will be based
                                          on the slightly higher account balance.
                                          Overall, this means that interest can be
                                          compounded several times in a year
                                          depending on the number of times that
                                          interest payments are made.
